NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite::Backend::Memcached - Memcache-driven
    storage backend for Throttle-Lite

VERSION
    version 0.02

DESCRIPTION
    This is implemetation of the storage backend for
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite. It uses memcache-server to hold
    throttling data, automatically sets expiration time for stored keys to
    save memory consumption.

SYNOPSYS
        # inside your app.psgi
        enable 'Throttle::Lite',
            backend => [
                'Memcached' => {
                    servers => [
                        'mc1.example.com:11211',
                        'mc1.example.com:11212',
                        'mc2.example.net:11210',
                    ],
                }
            ];

OPTIONS
    There are no backend-specific options. All options directly passing to
    downstream interface to memcached server. At the moment this is
    Cache::Memcached::Fast. See Cache::Memcached::Fast for available
    configuration options.

METHODS
  mc
    Returns a memcached connection handle.
